title: 'Disease-Atlas: Navigating Disease Trajectories using Deep Learning'
abstract: Joint models for longitudinal and time-to-event data are commonly used in
  longitudinal studies to forecast disease trajectories over time. While there are
  many advantages to joint modeling, the standard forms suffer from limitations that
  arise from a fixed model specification and computational difficulties when applied
  to high-dimensional datasets. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach
  to address these limitations, enhancing existing methods with the inherent flexibility
  and scalability of deep neural networks while retaining the benefits of joint modeling.
  Using longitudinal data from the UK Cystic Fibrosis Trust, we demonstrate improvements
  in performance and scalability, as well as robustness in the presence of irregularly
  sampled data.
